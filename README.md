# NSS CSharp Capstone Project


## Name of Project: “Health Care Assist Provider”


## Brief Proposal:
	A healthcare-related humanitarian project for three groups of people: 
* who need healthcare treatment, 
* who provide healthcare-related services (doctors), 
* who can provide an appropriate help to get healthcare treatment (philanthropists).
	The application creates a connection between people who cannot afford health insurance and healthcare providers like doctors and physicians.  In addition, philanthropists can donate money to help with external costs associated with treatments.


## Full Proposal:


## Stack: MVC 


## App Summary


## Overview of app: 


## MVP Definition: 
* User-specific CRUD for tree type of users: Patient, Doctor and Sponsor
* User-specific list view of reported issues
* Ability to make and edit comment for for each reported issue
* Display location of reported issue on online map
* Other crap for different user access levels


## Dream Stretch Goals:


## Things you want your mentor to check in on:


## User Stories 
(can be integrated into MVP definition):
(Given… when…. then…)


Given a Patient wants to view list of available Appointments for specific Speciality
 
When the employee clicks on the Employees item in the navigation bar
Then all current employees should be listed with the following information

First name and last name
Department




* As an app user, in order to report observed issue, I want to do it easy way
* As an app user, I want to keep track of my reports
* As an app user, in order to visualize my reports, I want to be able to view issue location marks on a map
* As an app user, in order to comment, edit comment, or remove reports that already been handled from active list,* I want to click on issue panel with image, and then the create/edit comment button. From there I can enter comment text and save it. I want to be able to close issue panel without making any changes
