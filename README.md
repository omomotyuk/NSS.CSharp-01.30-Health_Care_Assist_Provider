# NSS CSharp Capstone Project

## Name of Project: 	“Health Care Assist Provider”

## Brief Proposal:
A healthcare-related humanitarian project for three groups of people: 
who need healthcare treatment, 
who provide healthcare-related services (doctors), 
who can provide an appropriate help to get healthcare treatment (philanthropists).
